1. Problem Statement
This section clearly defines the current issues and pain points that the new system is intended to solve.

Inefficiency in Operations: It highlights that small to medium grocery stores suffer from operational bottlenecks due to manual or outdated processes.

Inventory Accuracy: It specifically mentions the problem of stockouts (not enough popular items) or overstocking (too much slow-moving product) due to inaccurate manual inventory tracking.

Lack of Insight: It addresses the management problem where store owners cannot get quick, real-time data on sales performance, profitability, or customer trends.

The Goal: The overall objective is stated as replacing manual and disorganized systems with a centralized, automated digital platform.

2. Scope of the Project
This section defines the boundaries of the initial project delivery.

Inclusions (What will be built):

The core Point-of-Sale (POS) interface for cashiers.

An Admin Dashboard for store management.

Fundamental inventory management capabilities (add, edit, track stock).

Generation of basic sales reports (summaries).

Basic user role management (e.g., Admin and Cashier logins).

Exclusions (What will NOT be built initially):

Complex integrations with external systems like accounting software.

Advanced features such as machine learning for predictive sales or dynamic pricing.

Development of a separate mobile application for customers or staff.

3. Target Users
This identifies the specific people who will be using the system and what they need.

Store Administrator/Owner: Their primary goal is to manage the business, minimize losses, and maximize profits. The system provides them with real-time data, alerts, and summarized reports.

Cashier/POS Operator: Their primary goal is to process customer transactions quickly and accurately. The system provides them with a fast, intuitive, and error-reducing checkout interface.

4. High-Level Features
This provides a brief list of the major functional modules the system will contain.

Sales & POS System: Focuses on transaction processing, including product lookup, multiple payment types, and receipt generation.

Inventory Management: Focuses on product data, automated stock deduction upon sale, and low-stock notifications.

Reporting & Analytics: Focuses on data output, including sales totals, transaction history, and tracking of top-selling products.

Security & User Roles: Focuses on access control and protection, ensuring secure login and role-based permissions (e.g., only Admin can view profit reports).
